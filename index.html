  <div class="content about">
    <p class="summary">I take ideas and transform them into stable robust platforms. I believe in simplicity, reliability, and efficiency. I favor production-ready over new and shiny.</p>
    <p class="summary">I traverse the stack on a daily basis. My work has encompassed both front and back end development, as well as healthy dose of DevOps. I write pixel-perfect front end code, but my true passion is for the back end. Optimizing servers and increasing availablity is as exciting to me as writing a new feature.</p>
    <p class="summary">When I'm not writing code I am most likely exploring San Francisco with my beagle Nibbler. I love to stay active and also enjoy a number of sports including curling, running, and surfing.</p>
    <p class="summary">I am currently seeking new opportunities. <a href="mailto:cdelauder@gmail.com" target="blank" class="email-link">Get in touch!</a></p>
