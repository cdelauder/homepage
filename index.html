  <div class="content about">
    <p class="summary">I take ideas and transform them into stable robust platforms. I believe in simplicity, reliability, and efficiency. I favor production-ready over new and shiny.</p>
    <p class="summary">In my career I routinely traverse the stack on a daily basis. My work has encompassed both front and back end development, as well as healthy dose of DevOps. I write pixel-perfect front end code, but my true passion is for the back end. Optimizing servers and increasing availablity is as exciting to me as writing a new feature.</p>
